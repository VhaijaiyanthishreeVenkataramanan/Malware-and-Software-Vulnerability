  In this simple assignment, you will need to first log in Eustis machine, then use telnet command to connect to cs department email server to manually send a pure text-based spam (faked) email to my specially created gmail account:  "ucf.cap6135@gmail.com". From this experiment, you will understand why there are so many untrusted email around and how easy for attackers to send out spam or phishing email.

Please follow the in-class illustration to send this faked email. In order to make these assignment email not be treated as the other spam email, you must follow the following specifications:

The email must have a subject line as "CAP6135: firstname lastname". Put your name in the subject line so that you can be credited. Otherwise our TA cannot tell who send this email!
The email must have a "from: ..." and the "to: ...." field that can been shown by recipient email agent. These two fields are displayed when you read an email. You should put the following "from:.." and "to:..." field in this email:  "from: IT-support@bankofEarth.com", "to: spamHW@CAP6135".    (HINT: they are typed in the "DATA" command section!)
You can type in two "rcpt to:" to include your own email address for verification in the second "rcpt to". Because CS email server now only support relay with a few local LAN IPs including Eustis, so you can only use Eustis server to issue telnet command to send this fake email to an arbitrary email address.
The email should have at least two lines of text message. You can write whatever you want in these multi-lines of text message.
  Submission:

You need to send this spam email AND submit your report via WebCourse before the due date/time.
The brief report should show (1). your telnet interaction steps using Screenshot images. (2). How you generate this pure text spam email. You MUST copy the SCREENSHOT IMAGE in your report showing the interaction steps when you create this spam (only the beginning part showing the interaction and the initial pasted few lines). A simple text showing the interaction is not good enough.
